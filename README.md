## My process

### Step by step

- create and link a .css file to the index
- set basic resources on css:root as colors, fonts or frameworks
- organize html tags and structure
- Mobile-first workflow
- match css and html
- media query
- Desk workflow

### What I learned

I studied graphic design and did not knew css has overlay layers mode. Mind blowinq. This is also a great exercise for padding and media queries.

```html
Understading this:
```
```css
padding: 20px 200px 0 40px;
padding-left:
padding-top:
```
```
```html
:o
```
